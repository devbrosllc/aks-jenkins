### Not started
* Add integration with Azure Container Registry
* Add steps for creating custom Jenkins image w/ plugins already installed
* Add simple bash script for kubectl deployment of template files
* Helm support? Worth doing?
* Will likely need to figure out proper access controls to the Jenkins frontend and ensure it's not wide open
