### Not started
* Kubernetes templates -- need to convert to helm charts
* Access controls for reaching cluster and Jenkins frontend; will need to create load balancer in Terraform and ensure only accessible by my public IP
* Will likely need to figure out proper access controls to the Jenkins frontend and ensure it's not wide open
### WIP
### Done
* Add integration with Azure Container Registry
* Add steps for creating custom Jenkins image w/ plugins already installed
